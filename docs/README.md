# JetNet Docs

We're using Sphinx with the Napolean extension, and the Google Python docstrings style.

## Build

Requirements are:
 - `sphinx`
 - `autodocsumm`

And then you can run the following command to build locally

```bash
make html
```

After which you can open the `docs/_build/html/index.html` file in your browser.
